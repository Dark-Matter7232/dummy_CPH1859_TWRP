If you started building TWRP/ROM then these instaructions are for you.

After repo initialization and before repo sync you have to add a file for syncing device tree and kernel source (TWRP). In case of ROM you have to add vendor tree also.

A. Instructions (after repo init):

1. cd <source_dir>
2.clone this repo https://github.com/mauronofrio/android_bootable_recovery/commits/android-9.0


Kernel source is available but it has lot of issues. Used prebuilt kernel. Note: Using prebuilt kernels in building is deprecated.

Now perform 

repo sync -j(nproc --all) -c

All the sources along with your TWRP device tree and kernel source (if available) will be downloaded.


B. Instructions (After repo sync):

After repo sync you have to tell buildbot to include your device for building TWRP. So for this you can either make a vendorsetup.sh file in your device tree or can edit the available file in TWRP source.

To edit vendorsetup.sh file in the downloaded TWRP source. Head to the below location.

1. cd <source_dir>/vendor/omni/

2. nano vendorsetup.sh

Now add below line at the end.

	add_lunch_combo omni_RMX1831-eng

3. Save file and exit.

You can also choose user or userdbug. But they are not required for TWRP.


##Now start the build process using the command given in README.md
